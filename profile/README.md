# About the FDZ Ruhr
The FDZ Ruhr provides data available to external scientists for non-commercial use only – there are some exceptions for the Public Use Files (PUF) and Campus Files. Use is project-related and possible in two ways, as a Scientific Use File (SUF) and as a visiting scientist (on-site use). These differ in terms of the degree of anonymization of the data provided and in terms of the mobility of data use. Scientific Use Files are de facto anonymized data that can be analyzed by researchers at their respective scientific institutions. If a Scientific Use File is available, on-site use is only possible after using the SUF. Visiting researchers have access to weakly anonymized data, the use of which must comply with a number of privacy rules. For this reason, analysis of this data is only possible during a guest's stay in our data security room. Both types of access require an application from the user. The management of the FDZ Ruhr decides on the release of the requested data according to defined rules.

# Data Access
If you are interested in any of our datasets, you can easily request them [online](https://www.rwi-essen.de/en/research-advice/further/research-data-center-ruhr-fdz/data-access). Please also note our [Terms of Use](https://www.rwi-essen.de/en/research-advice/further/research-data-center-ruhr-fdz/data-access).

The FDZ Ruhr expects responsible use of the data provided. Any attempt to identify individuals (individuals, companies or comparable groups) is to be avoided. Should an unintentional re-anonymization occur, the data provider must be notified immediately. Data that contain personal references or for which there is a possibility of re-anonymization are generally only made available for the purposes of scientific research. For this purpose, the FDZ Ruhr concludes user agreements with the legal representatives of the research institutions. When using these data, it must be ensured that the data protection regulations according to Art. 29 DS-GVO, Art. 5 DS-GVO, Art. 89 DS-GVO and §78 SGBX as well as the appendices to Art. 32 para. l DS-GVO and §78 SGBX are adhered to. Our data will not be transferred to countries that are not considered by the European Union to have adequate data protection. For data protection reasons, we can only provide our data to applicants and users in EU countries and countries with a comparable data protection agreements. If you are a data user from another country, please write to us at fdz@rwi-essen.de.
